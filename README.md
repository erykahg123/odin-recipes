# odin-recipes
# I had a lot of fun doing my first project for TOP. I have been working as a consultant for a while now, and while I have some programming knowledge it is a breath of fresh air to be learning a new skill on my own, outside of work. I compiled some of my favorite fall baking recipes into one central location. I learned  a lot completing this project and it has made me so excited for what is to come!
# Please note that these recipes are not my own! I am working on software development, my baking hobby is on the side ;) maybe one day I will have a site for my recipes but today is not that day! Sally's Baking Addiction is my go to!
# The hardest part of this project wasn't the HTML portion, as I have had some experience in the past. I struggled with the VSCode/GitHub,Git connection. It took me a while to understand how to actually push my work onto GitHub and I had to go back a few lessons and slow down on the Git section.
